# NaNoE
A custom NaNoWriMo writing application I started writing for myself.

It has a simplified interface and a minimal way to interact with the elements you want to remember, and the plot. It is just to be quick at flying over your notes to help you write your novel.

It also has minimal editing resources to help you adjust your novel. I have look through tips and tricks, I just don't have all the features yet (you will see the plans in comments).

## Build
Build with Visual Studio 2017 on a Windows 10 PC.
Uses nuget package(s):
 - DocX by Xceed
 
## NaNoE.V2
Information coming soon. It will be its own repo.

## Side Notes
Tried my best to also allow it on 32bit computers, that way I can use it on my machines I have access to.

# Why Free and Open Source
Essentially I chose to keep it free and open source as any help would be appreciated. If you have suggestions and features we could add it would be awesome.

The important part is to assist myself in writing to 50,000 words for NaNoWriMo in November every time.

If it helps anyone else, be my guest. You can use it, and adjust it in the ways you need it to change.
